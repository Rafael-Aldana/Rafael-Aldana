### HOW I BECAME A DEVELOPER

Hey there my name is Rafael, and my journey in the tech industry began after I decided to quit working for the military. For a while I was hesitant because I didn't know what to do. 

When I left the active duty ARMY in 2019, I started working as contractor for the US NAVY. I maintained that job throughout the COVID 19 pandemic. In between this I also served in the Washington state national guard. I was activated for COVID 19 relief and I also got deployed to Eastern Europe in the meanwhile. Coming back from deployment my time in the national guard was about to be over, once again I had to evaluate my life and what I wanted to do in the future.

I decided to extend for a year in the national guard but, ultimately I ended up quitting my job as a contractor with the NAVY. I began to look for a brighter future with lots of new opportunities. And that landed me at CODE FELLOWS. Where I am currently a student taking a full stack web developement in JavaScript. I am eagerly looking forward to a life as a dev, and I'm welcoming what life has instored for me with a full heart and a great big smile!
